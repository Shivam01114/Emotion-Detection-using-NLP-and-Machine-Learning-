# Emotion-Detection-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning-

🧠 Emotion Detection Using Machine Learning | NLP Project

I recently built a Text-Based Emotion Detection Model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
The goal of this project was to analyze text and automatically classify the emotion behind it — such as sadness, joy, anger, love, fear, etc.


🔍 Key Steps in the Project:

📌 Dataset preprocessing (removing punctuation, numbers, emojis, stopwords)

📌 Tokenization & Text normalization

📌 Vectorization using TF-IDF

📌 Model Training & Evaluation

📌 Real-Time prediction system using user input

🧪 Models Used & Accuracy:

Model	Technique	Accuracy

Multinomial Naive Bayes (BoW)	Basic frequency method	76%
Multinomial Naive Bayes (TF-IDF)	Weighted importance	66%
Logistic Regression (TF-IDF)	Best performing model	86% 🚀


💡 Features:

✔ Detects emotion from any text input
✔ Works in real-time (user can type and get instant prediction)
✔ NLP pipeline fully automated



🛠 Tech Stack:

Python
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib 
Seaborn 
Scikit-learn
NLTK
TF-IDF Vectorizer



🌟 This project helped me understand how text processing, feature engineering, and machine learning models work together to build intelligent NLP systems.
